DCI project aiming Javascript
=============================

Terminology:
    - actor: an object that will interact inside a context
    - context: a use case scenario where one ore more actors will act
    - role: a set of abilities and attributes to be given to an actor
    - context object: whenever a context is used, a new context object will be created that will handle role assignment and other things (not clear at the moment)

This is still a very incomplete project under heavy development, I'm still not sure I like the api as it is now

For anyone interested, Eunomia is the ancient greek goddess of law and order
