DCI project aiming Javascript
=============================

------------
- actor: an object, with a specific set of roles, that will interact inside a context with other actors
- entity: an actor wannabe, any object that has not received yet a role
- context: a use case scenario where one ore more actors will act
- role: a set of abilities and attributes to be given to an actor
- context object: whenever a context is used, a new context object will be created that will handle role assignment and other things (not clear at the moment)

This is still a very incomplete project under heavy development, I'm still not sure I like the api as it is now

For anyone interested, Eunomia is the ancient greek goddess of law and order
